    <h1>Black Cat - by Rainer Maria Rilke</h1>
    <p>A ghost, though invisible, still is like a place<br />
      your sight can knock on, echoing; but here<br />
      within this thick black pelt, your strongest gaze<br />
      will be absorbed and utterly disappear:</p>

      <p>just as a raving madman, when nothing else<br />
        can ease him, charges into his dark night<br />
        howling, pounds on the padded wall, and feels<br />
        the rage being taken in and pacified.</p>

        <p>She seems to hide all looks that have ever fallen<br />
          into her, so that, like an audience,<br />
          she can look them over, menacing and sullen,<br />
          and curl to sleep with them. But all at once</p>

          <p>as if awakened, she turns her face to yours;<br />
            and with a shock, you see yourself, tiny,<br />
            inside the golden amber of her eyeballs<br />
            suspended, like a prehistoric fly.</p>
